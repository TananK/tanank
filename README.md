# Tanan Kesornbua Showcase
Thank you for visiting my portfolio. My expertise is in the area of data analysis and visualization, business intelligence solution, geospatial technology, and cloud-based ETL processes. Some of my notable achievements are:

* Developed end-to-end monitoring systems for two machine learning pipelines on AWS that classified more than 200 GB of geospatial data daily which increase map coverage by 30%
* Designed and managed human-in-the-loop validation processes for the ML pipelines
* Developed an anomaly detection system for 30 geo-attributes in the Maps Change Warehouse database
